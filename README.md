# Deezer for Lidarr
This plugin provides a Deezer indexer and downloader client for Lidarr using direct communication rather than using Deemix as a middleman.

### ⚠️ WARNING: Deezer seems to be cracking down on downloading tools and this wasn't designed super well for that, I've made minor changes to try to improve it, but there's still no guarantee you won't be limited or banned. ⚠️

## Installation
This requires your Lidarr setup to be using the `plugins` branch. My docker-compose is setup like the following.
```yml
  lidarr:
    image: ghcr.io/hotio/lidarr:pr-plugins
    container_name: lidarr
    environment:
      - PUID:100
      - PGID:1001
      - TZ:Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config/:/config
      - /path/to/downloads/:/downloads
      - /path/to/music:/music
    ports:
      - 8686:8686
    restart: unless-stopped
```

1. In Lidarr, go to `System -> Plugins`, paste `https://github.com/TrevTV/Lidarr.Plugin.Deezer` into the GitHub URL box, and press Install.
2. Go into the Indexer settings and press Add. In the modal, choose `Deezer` (under Other at the bottom).
3. If you have a specific ARL you want to use, paste it into the box, if you don't, the plugin will automatically pick one for you. Then press Save. It will load for awhile as it performs a lot of calls to Deezer.
4. Go into the Download Client settings and press Add. In the modal, choose `Deezer` (under Other at the bottom).
5. Put the path you want to download tracks to and fill out the other settings to your choosing.
   - If you want `.lrc` files to be saved, go into the Media Management settings and enable Import Extra Files and add `lrc` to the list.
6. Go into the Profile settings and find the Delay Profiles. On each (by default there is only one), click the wrench on the right and toggle Deezer on.
7. Optional: To prevent Lidarr from downloading all track files into the base artist folder rather than into their own separate album folder, go into the Media Management settings and enable Rename Tracks. You can change the formats to your liking, but it helps to let each album have their own folder.
